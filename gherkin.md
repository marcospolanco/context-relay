As a system user
I want to initialize a new context with initial input
So that I can start a context relay session

Feature: Context Initialization
  As a system user
  I want to initialize a new context with initial input
  So that I can start a context relay session

    Given the embedding service is available
    And MongoDB is connected and ready
    And the SSE event system is initialized

    Then the response status should be 200
    And the context packet should contain fragments for each constraint and preference
    And embeddings should be computed for all fragments
    And metadata should preserve the complex input structure

  Scenario: Context initialization failure due to invalid input
    Given I have a session ID "session-789"
    And I have invalid initial input null
    When I POST to "/context/initialize" with invalid data
    Then the response status should be 400
    And the response should contain an error message
    And an "error" event should be broadcast with:

          "message": "Initial input cannot be null"
        }
      }
      """
    And no context should be created in MongoDB

  Scenario: Context initialization with embedding service failure
    Given the embedding service is unavailable
    And I have valid initialization data
    When I POST to "/context/initialize" with valid data
    Then the response status should be 503
    And an "error" event should be broadcast with:

### Feature: Server-Sent Events for Real-time Updates
As a frontend application
I want to receive real-time event streams from the logic layer
So that I can provide live visualizations of context operations

```gherkin
Feature: Server-Sent Events for Real-time Updates
  As a frontend application
  I want to receive real-time event streams from the logic layer
  So that I can provide live visualizations of context operations

  Background:
    Given the SSE endpoint is available at "/events/relay"
    And the event broadcasting system is initialized

  Scenario: Successful SSE connection and event reception
    Given I have a frontend client connecting to the SSE endpoint
    When I GET to "/events/relay" with Accept: "text/event-stream"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response content-type should be "text/event-stream"
    And the connection should remain open
    And I should receive events in SSE format:
      """
      event: contextInitialized
      data: {"context_id": "ctx-123", "context_packet": {...}}

      event: relaySent

      event: relayReceived
      data: {"to_agent": "Agent B", "context_id": "ctx-123", ...}
      """

  Scenario: Multiple clients receive same events
    Given I have multiple frontend clients connected
    When a context operation occurs
    Then all connected clients should receive the same events
    And events should be delivered in the same order to all clients
    And each client should maintain its own connection state

  Scenario: Client disconnection handling
    Given a client is connected to the SSE endpoint
    When the client disconnects
    Then the server should detect the disconnection
    And the client's queue should be removed from subscribers
    And no memory leaks should occur from abandoned connections

  Scenario: High-frequency event broadcasting
    Given multiple context operations occur rapidly
    When events are broadcast to subscribers
    Then all events should be delivered in order
    And no events should be dropped due to high frequency
    And event timestamps should reflect the actual occurrence time

  Scenario: SSE reconnection with Last-Event-ID
    Given a client was disconnected after receiving event with ID "evt-123"
    When the client reconnects with "Last-Event-ID: evt-123"
    Then the server should resume streaming from events after "evt-123"
    And the client should not receive duplicate events
    And no events should be lost during the reconnection

  Scenario: Event broadcasting during system errors
    Given a critical error occurs in the logic layer
    When the error is handled
    Then an "error" event should be broadcast to all clients
    And the error event should contain error_code and message
    And client connections should remain stable

  Scenario: SSE endpoint with authentication
    Given the system requires authentication for SSE connections
    When I connect without proper authentication
    Then the connection should be rejected with 401 status
    When I connect with valid authentication
    Then the connection should be accepted and events should stream

    Then the response status should be 400
    And the response should contain a JSON parsing error message
    And an "error" event should be broadcast with:
      """
      {
        "type": "error",
        "payload": {
          "error_code": "INVALID_JSON",
          "message": "Invalid JSON in request body"
        }
      }
      """

  Scenario: Missing required fields in requests
    Given I send a request missing required fields
    When I POST to "/context/initialize" without "session_id"
    Then the response status should be 422
    And the response should list the missing required fields
    And no partial processing should occur

  Scenario: Database connection failure
    Given MongoDB becomes unavailable during operations
    When I try to perform any context operation
    Then the response status should be 503
    And an "error" event should be broadcast with database error details
    And the system should attempt to reconnect to the database

  Scenario: Embedding service timeout
    Given the embedding service is responding slowly
    And the timeout threshold is 30 seconds
    When I request embeddings that exceed the timeout
    Then the operation should fail with 504 status
    And the error should indicate which service timed out
    And partial context modifications should be rolled back

  Scenario: Concurrent write conflicts
    Given two agents try to modify the same context simultaneously
    And Agent A's operation starts first
    And Agent B's operation tries to write to an older version
    When Agent B's operation is processed
    Then the response status should be 409
    And the response should include the current context version
    And Agent B should retry with the updated context

  Scenario: Memory pressure handling
    Given the system is under high memory load
    And a large context operation is requested
    When the operation would exceed memory limits
    Then the request should be rejected with 507 status
    And the error should suggest breaking the operation into smaller chunks
    And existing operations should continue normally

  Scenario: Rate limiting for abusive requests
    Given a client is making excessive requests
    And the rate limit is 100 requests per minute
    When the client exceeds the rate limit
    Then the response status should be 429
    And the response should include retry-after header
    And legitimate requests from other clients should continue working

  Scenario: Circuit breaker for failing dependencies
    Given the embedding service has failed multiple times
    And the circuit breaker threshold is 5 failures
    When the 6th failure occurs
    Then the circuit breaker should open
    And subsequent embedding requests should fail fast
    And the system should attempt to close the circuit breaker after a timeout

## Backend Integration

### Feature: MongoDB Integration
As a system architect
I want the logic layer to properly integrate with MongoDB
So that context data is reliably stored and retrieved

```gherkin
Feature: MongoDB Integration
  As a system architect
  I want the logic layer to properly integrate with MongoDB
  So that context data is reliably stored and retrieved

  Background:
    Given MongoDB is running and accessible
    And the necessary collections exist with proper indexes

  Scenario: Store context packet with all required fields
    Given I have a complete context packet
    When I store the context in MongoDB
    Then the document should be saved in the "contexts" collection
    And the context_id field should be indexed for fast lookup
    And the version field should be indexed for version queries
    And all nested objects should be properly serialized

  Scenario: Retrieve context packet by ID
    Given a context with ID "ctx-retrieve" exists in MongoDB
    When I GET to "/context/ctx-retrieve"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should contain the complete context packet
    And the response should match the stored document exactly
    And the response should include decision trace and metadata

  Scenario: Atomic context updates with version increment
    Given a context exists at version 3
    When I perform a relay operation that updates the context
    Then the update should be atomic in MongoDB
    And the version should increment to 4
    And the previous version should be preserved if versioning is enabled
    And concurrent updates should not overwrite each other

  Scenario: Context search and filtering
    Given multiple contexts exist with different metadata
    When I search for contexts by metadata fields
    Then MongoDB should return matching contexts efficiently
    And metadata searches should use appropriate indexes
    And results should be ordered by relevance or timestamp

  Scenario: MongoDB connection pool management
    Given the system is under high load
    When multiple operations require database access
    Then the connection pool should handle concurrent requests
    And connections should be properly reused
    And no connection leaks should occur

  Scenario: MongoDB write concern and read preferences
    Given context operations require high consistency
    When writing critical context data
    Then write operations should use appropriate write concern
    And read operations should use appropriate read preferences
    And the system should handle replica set elections gracefully
```

### Feature: Embedding Service Integration
As a system architect
I want the logic layer to properly integrate with embedding services
So that semantic analysis and similarity detection work correctly

```gherkin
Feature: Embedding Service Integration
  As a system architect
  I want the logic layer to properly integrate with embedding services
  So that semantic analysis and similarity detection work correctly

  Background:
    Given the embedding service is running and accessible
    And the service supports the required embedding model

  Scenario: Generate embeddings for new fragments
    Given I have new context fragments without embeddings
    When I process these fragments through the embedding service
    Then each fragment should receive a vector embedding
    And embeddings should have consistent dimensions
    And the embedding service should return confidence scores
    And failed embeddings should be retried or marked as errors

  Scenario: Batch embedding processing for efficiency
    Given I have 50 fragments that need embeddings
    When I request batch embedding processing
    Then all 50 embeddings should be generated in a single request
    And the batch operation should be more efficient than individual requests
    And partial failures should be handled gracefully
    And the system should fall back to individual requests if batch fails

  Scenario: Vector similarity search for conflict detection
    Given I have fragments with existing embeddings
    And I need to detect semantically similar fragments
    When I perform vector similarity search
    Then the system should find fragments above the similarity threshold
    And similarity scores should be accurate and consistent
    And the search should be performant for large fragment sets

  Scenario: Embedding service fallback and redundancy
    Given the primary embedding service becomes unavailable
    When embedding requests are made
    Then the system should failover to a backup embedding service
    Or the system should queue requests for retry when service returns
    And existing operations should continue with available data

  Scenario: Embedding caching and optimization
    Given the same content might be processed multiple times
    When I request embeddings for duplicate content
    Then cached embeddings should be used when available
    And the cache should have appropriate TTL policies
    And cache misses should trigger fresh embedding generation
```

## Integration Testing Scenarios

### Feature: End-to-End Context Relay Flow
As a system tester
I want to test the complete context relay workflow
So that all components work together correctly

```gherkin
Feature: End-to-End Context Relay Flow
  As a system tester
  I want to test the complete context relay workflow
  So that all components work together correctly

  Scenario: Complete workflow from initialization to final version
    Given I am a frontend application user
    And all backend services are running
    When I start a new context relay session:
      1. Initialize context with initial input
      2. Relay context from Agent A to Agent B with new fragments
      3. Merge additional context from Agent C
      4. Prune context to fit budget constraints
      5. Create final version snapshot
    Then all operations should succeed
    And all events should be streamed via SSE
    And the final context should contain all relevant information
    And the version history should track all changes

  Scenario: Error recovery and system resilience
    Given I am testing system resilience
    When various failures occur during operations:
      - Database temporary unavailability
      - Embedding service slowdowns
      - Network connection issues
      - High concurrent load
    Then the system should handle errors gracefully
    And operations should retry or fail appropriately
    And the system should recover when services return
    And data integrity should be maintained
```

## Code Generation Notes

This Gherkin specification provides:

1. **Executable test scenarios** that can be directly implemented with pytest-bdd
2. **Clear acceptance criteria** for each FastAPI endpoint
3. **Event flow specifications** for SSE implementation
4. **Error handling requirements** for resilience testing
5. **Integration test cases** for end-to-end validation
6. **Specific JSON examples** for request/response validation

Each scenario includes:
- Detailed request/response payloads
- Expected event broadcasts
- Database state requirements
- Error conditions and handling
- Performance and scalability considerations

The scenarios are structured to enable automated test generation and provide clear guidance for implementing the FastAPI logic layer according to the original logic.md specification.
