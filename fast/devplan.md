# Context Relay System - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) plan for the Context Relay System. The `gherkin.md` specification is the single source of truth for the system's behavior. All development and testing will be driven by implementing the Gherkin scenarios.

**Priority #1: Deliver a complete, mocked, and BDD-tested API for the frontend developer as quickly as possible.**

## Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: BDD-Driven Mock API Implementation (2-3 days) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **Phase 2**: Core Functionality (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Production Hardening (1 week)

## Phase 1: BDD-Driven Mock API Implementation (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Provide the frontend developer with a fully functional FastAPI server that passes all BDD scenarios from `gherkin.md` using mock data. This enables parallel frontend development against a reliable, behaviorally-correct API contract.

### Phase 1.1: Project & BDD Framework Setup (Day 1)

#### 1.1.1 FastAPI Project Structure
```
context-relay/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ... (same as before)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context_initialization.feature
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (gherkin files)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ steps/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test_context_steps.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ .env
```

#### 1.1.2 Dependencies
```txt
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
pydantic==2.5.0
python-multipart==0.0.6
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-bdd==6.1.1
httpx==0.25.1
```

#### 1.1.3 Configure BDD Test Framework
- Configure `pytest` and `pytest-bdd` to recognize `.feature` files.
- Set up linters and formatters to ensure code quality.
- Establish CI pipeline to run BDD tests on every commit.

### Phase 1.2: Foundational Models & Services (Day 1)

#### 1.2.1 Complete Pydantic Models
Implement all models from `logic.md` specification to define the data contracts.

#### 1.2.2 Mock Data Service
Implement a basic `MockDataService` to generate realistic data for passing BDD scenarios.

### Phase 1.3: BDD-Driven Mock API Implementation (Day 1-2)

**Goal**: Implement mock API endpoints and logic by making Gherkin scenarios pass one by one. Development for a feature is complete only when its scenarios pass.

#### 1.3.1 Implement Gherkin Scenarios: Context Initialization
- Develop the `POST /context/initialize` endpoint.
- Write mock logic to satisfy all scenarios in the "Context Initialization" feature.
- Ensure the implementation passes all `pytest-bdd` tests for this feature.

#### 1.3.2 Implement Gherkin Scenarios: Context Relay
- Develop the `POST /context/relay` endpoint.
- Write mock logic to handle relays, conflicts, and removals as described in the scenarios.
- Ensure all "Context Relay" scenarios pass.

#### 1.3.3 Implement Gherkin Scenarios: Context Merging & Pruning
- Develop `POST /context/merge` and `POST /context/prune` endpoints.
- Implement mock logic for different strategies.
- Ensure all "Context Merging" and "Context Pruning" scenarios pass.

#### 1.3.4 Implement Gherkin Scenarios: Versioning
- Develop `POST /context/version` and `GET /context/versions/{context_id}`.
- Ensure all "Versioning Operations" scenarios pass.

#### 1.3.5 Implement Gherkin Scenarios: SSE Event Streaming
- Develop the `GET /events/relay` endpoint.
- Implement the event broadcasting system.
- Write tests to verify that all operations trigger the correct SSE events as specified in the Gherkin scenarios.

### Phase 1.4: Documentation & Frontend Handoff (Day 3)

#### 1.4.1 API Documentation
- Auto-generate OpenAPI docs from the FastAPI implementation.
- Add examples directly from the Gherkin scenarios to the documentation.

#### 1.4.2 Frontend Integration Guide & Quick Start
- Provide a guide for the frontend developer on how to connect to the mock API and SSE stream.
- Include a `docker-compose` or simple script to run the BDD-tested mock server.

### Phase 1.5: Frontend Collaboration (Daily)

#### 1.5.1 Formal Frontend Developer Sync
- Schedule a brief daily sync with the frontend developer.
- **Goal**: Validate that the mock API's behavior and data structures are meeting frontend needs, preventing rework.
- Adjust mock data generation based on feedback.

---

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Replace mock implementations with real business logic and backend integrations, ensuring all BDD scenarios continue to pass.

### Phase 2.1: Database Integration (3-4 days)

#### 2.1.1 MongoDB Setup & Persistence
- Integrate MongoDB and implement data persistence for all context operations.
- Refactor BDD test step definitions to use a real test database instead of in-memory objects.

### Phase 2.2: Embedding Service Integration (3-4 days)

#### 2.2.1 Embedding Client & Vector Operations
- Integrate the real embedding service client.
- Update BDD tests to mock the embedding service API, ensuring the application handles it correctly.

### Phase 2.3: BDD-Driven Business Logic Implementation (4-5 days)

**Goal**: Re-implement the business logic for each feature, driven by the Gherkin scenarios.

#### 2.3.1 Implement Relay Scenarios with Real Logic
- Replace mock conflict detection with real semantic similarity checks.
- Ensure all "Context Relay" scenarios pass with the new logic.

#### 2.3.2 Implement Merge Scenarios with Real Logic
- Implement union, semantic similarity, and overwrite strategies using real data and embeddings.
- Ensure all "Context Merging" scenarios pass.

#### 2.3.3 Implement Pruning Scenarios with Real Logic
- Implement recency, semantic diversity, and importance-based pruning.
- Ensure all "Context Pruning" scenarios pass.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)

**Goal**: Implement advanced features, adding new Gherkin scenarios as needed to define their behavior.

### Phase 3.1: Advanced Conflict Detection (3-4 days)
- **BDD First**: Write new scenarios for advanced conflict cases.
- Implement sophisticated similarity algorithms and decision trace analysis to make these new scenarios pass.

### Phase 3.2: Performance Optimizations (3-4 days)
- Implement caching and batch processing.
- BDD tests are used to verify functional correctness after optimization.

### Phase 3.3: Advanced Features (4-5 days)
- **BDD First**: Write new scenarios for multi-agent coordination, advanced versioning, etc.
- Implement the features to make the scenarios pass.

## Phase 4: Production Hardening (1 week)

**Goal**: Prepare system for production deployment, with BDD tests forming the core of regression testing.

### Phase 4.1: Testing & Quality (2-3 days)
- **BDD Suite**: The full suite of Gherkin scenarios serves as the primary regression test suite.
- Augment with integration, load, and error scenario testing.

### Phase 4.2: Monitoring & Observability (2 days)
- Implement logging, metrics, and health checks.

### Phase 4.3: Security & Deployment (2 days)
- Implement authentication, rate limiting, and production deployment configurations.

## Risk Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks
- **Risk**: Mock data not realistic enough.
- **Mitigation**: Use real examples from Gherkin scenarios. **Formal daily sync with frontend developer to validate data and behavior.**

### Phase 2 Risks
- **Risk**: Backend service integration delays.
- **Mitigation**: The BDD-tested mock API from Phase 1 provides a stable fallback for frontend development.

### Overall Risks
- **Risk**: Scope creep.
- **Mitigation**: All new functionality must be defined in a Gherkin scenario first, making scope changes explicit and deliberate.
