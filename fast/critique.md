# Critique of Development and Test Plans

## Overall Assessment

The `devplan.md` and `testplan.md` are exceptionally detailed and well-structured. The phased approach, prioritization of a mock API for frontend enablement, and comprehensive test coverage strategy are excellent. The plans demonstrate a strong understanding of the project requirements and a commitment to quality.

This critique focuses on refining the integration between the plans, specifically strengthening the connection to the BDD scenarios outlined in `gherkin.md` to ensure they are used as an executable specification rather than just a reference document.

## Development Plan (`devplan.md`) Critique

The development plan is solid, but it can be improved by more explicitly integrating the BDD workflow into the development process itself.

1.  **Integrate BDD into Core Tasks**: The plan treats the Gherkin scenarios as a reference. It should instead treat them as a direct driver for development. Phase 1.3 (Mock API Endpoints) and 2.3 (Business Logic) tasks should be framed as "Implement the Gherkin scenarios for Context Initialization," "Implement Relay scenarios," etc. This ensures development is always aligned with the specified behavior.

2.  **Shift Testing Earlier in Phase 1**: The plan lists "Documentation & Testing" (1.6) as the final step in the mock API phase. Testing should not be a separate, final step. Each endpoint and its corresponding business logic should be developed in tandem with its tests. For example, task 1.3.1 (implementing the `/context/initialize` endpoint) should be complete only when the corresponding Gherkin scenarios pass against it.

3.  **Establish a Formal Frontend Feedback Loop**: The risk mitigation for "Mock data not realistic enough" is good, but the plan should include a formal, scheduled action item for it. Add a "Phase 1.x: Frontend Developer Sync" task to occur daily or every other day to ensure the mock API is genuinely meeting frontend needs as it's being built, preventing rework.

4.  **Add Foundational Tooling Setup**: Phase 1.1 (Project Setup) should include an explicit task (e.g., 1.1.3) for "Configure and validate testing and linting tools." This includes setting up `pytest`, `pytest-bdd`, and any code formatters/linters. This ensures the development environment is fully prepared for the test-driven approach from day one.

## Test Plan (`testplan.md`) Critique

The test plan is thorough but misses the key opportunity to leverage the Gherkin scenarios for true BDD. The current plan describes a traditional testing structure, not one driven by the Gherkin specification.

5.  **Adopt Executable BDD Scenarios**: This is the most critical point. The test plan should be restructured to directly reflect the implementation of `gherkin.md`. Instead of generic `TestContextEndpoints` classes, the plan should specify the creation of `test_context_initialization.py`, `test_context_relay.py`, etc., containing `pytest-bdd` step definitions (`@given`, `@when`, `@then`) that map directly to the Gherkin text. This makes the Gherkin file the executable source of truth for the system's behavior.

6.  **Refine Mock API Testing Focus**: The plan includes unit tests for the mock data service and mock operations. While some testing is necessary, the primary goal of Phase 1 testing should be to **validate the API contract**, not the mock's internal logic. The plan should emphasize that tests will confirm the mock API returns the correct schemas, status codes, and SSE event formats as defined in `gherkin.md`, ensuring it's a perfect stand-in for the real implementation.

7.  **Define the SSE Client Test Strategy**: Section 1.6.2 (SSE Client Testing) is vague. The plan should specify *how* the SSE stream will be tested. This should involve writing an automated test client (using a library like `httpx`) that connects to the `/events/relay` endpoint, performs actions via the API, and asserts that the correct events are received in the correct order, as dictated by the Gherkin scenarios.

8.  **Align Test Data with Gherkin `Given` Steps**: The plan mentions using `factory_boy` and `faker`, which is excellent. It should explicitly state that the test data generation will be driven by the `Given` steps in the Gherkin scenarios. For example, the step `Given a context exists with ID "ctx-123"` will trigger a fixture that creates that precise state in the test database. This creates a clear and maintainable link between the specification and the test setup.

## Summary Recommendation

The project should fully commit to a BDD workflow where `gherkin.md` is the central, executable specification.

9.  **Treat `gherkin.md` as the Single Source of Truth**: Both `devplan.md` and `testplan.md` should be updated to reflect that the primary goal of development and testing is to make the scenarios in `gherkin.md` pass. All development tasks should correspond to implementing a feature or scenario, and all testing efforts should be focused on automating those scenarios. Any ambiguity in requirements should be resolved by updating the Gherkin file first.
